Two weeks ago, I attended the [update prague conference](https://www.updateconference.net/en), the biggest .NET developer conference in the Czech Republic. This was the first time I was at update prague and I was really impressed by the quality of the talks and the overall organization. I was able to attend 2 days of the conference and I want to share some of the highlights with you.

I've joined the following sessions (in chronological order):
- fasdf
- resfasd
- aweta sts
- atwet dfasd
