In today's world, moving mission-critical applications to the cloud is a necessity, offering scalability and cost-efficiency. However, this shift relinquishes control over infrastructure, raising the crucial question of maintaining reliability and availability.

As cloud-native applications grow in complexity, the need for rigorous testing becomes evident. Outages often result from failed deployments or erroneous releases. Moreover, post-deployment issues can plague complex, multi-tenant cloud environments. These challenges call for resiliency measures like retry logic and autoscaling, often overlooked during development.

In this blog, we'll explore the importance of verifying and testing cloud reliability for mission-critical applications, focusing on strategies to ensure uninterrupted service, even in complex, dynamic cloud environments.

## The Complex World of Cloud-Native Applications

As cloud-native applications and services become more complex, deploying changes and new releases becomes increasingly challenging. Outages are often the result of failed deployments or erroneous releases. Even after deployment, issues can arise when real-world traffic starts to hit the application, particularly in highly distributed, multi-tenanted cloud environments with multiple development teams involved. This complexity calls for enhanced resiliency measures, such as retry logic and autoscaling, which are typically overlooked during the development process.

## Verifying and Testing Cloud Reliability

To ensure mission-critical applications can thrive in the cloud, it's crucial to have robust testing and verification strategies in place. This section will cover best practices for testing cloud reliability, identifying potential weak points in your applications, and implementing measures to address them.

## CI/CD and the Cloud

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) plays a pivotal role in maintaining reliability and availability in the cloud. We'll explore how CI/CD practices can be leveraged to ensure seamless transitions, reduce deployment-related outages, and enhance the overall reliability of your mission-critical applications.
