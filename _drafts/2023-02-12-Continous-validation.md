*Some short introduction*

As a software engineer I see a lot of project that have the focus on creating business functionality. A business functionality doesn't only consist of the functional requirements that we have to implement as software engineers. There is always a form of non-functional requirements (nfr) that are as (if not more) important as the functional requirements, but are not treated that way.

Even if the functional requirements are all implemented perfectly, a software system can completely fail if the nfr's like performance and availability are not met. This means that every time your architecture or code changes, you should verify that **all of your requirements** are still met. The process of continously checking your nfr's is called **continuous validation**.

##  Understanding non-functional requirements

There are a lot of nfr's

Explain why non-functional requirements are important and how they differ from functional requirements

III. The Challenges of Validating Non-Functional Requirements

Discuss the difficulties that can arise when validating non-functional requirements
Explain why it can be challenging to measure non-functional requirements, such as performance, reliability, and security

IV. The Benefits of Continuous Validation

Explain the concept of continuous validation and how it applies to non-functional requirements
Discuss the benefits of continuous validation, such as reducing risk and increasing stakeholder confidence

V. Strategies for Continuous Validation of Non-Functional Requirements

Describe the different strategies that can be used to continuously validate non-functional requirements, such as automated testing, performance monitoring, and user feedback
Explain how each strategy works and provide examples

VI. Best Practices for Continuous Validation

Provide some best practices for continuous validation, such as establishing a clear validation plan, involving stakeholders in the process, and using metrics to track progress
Explain why these best practices are important and how they can help ensure the success of the project
