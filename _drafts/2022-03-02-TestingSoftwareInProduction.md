This is the first blog in a series about innovative patterns in software quality management. In this blog I will give you an introduction into testing software in production. Each next blog will zoom in into a specific part of the software development pipeline that is connected to testing software in production.

The software development pipeline tradionally follows a status quo. This status quo consists of the following steps:
- Building/running tests via a CI/CD pipeline;
- Deploying your software to a test environment;
- Testing your software;
- Deploying your software to an acceptance/staging environment;
- Doing acceptance testing;
- Deploying and releasing your software to production.

This process is developed in the years in which we ran our software on physical machines. There we had to be sure that our software worked as expected before we deployed it to production. This process usually took a lot of time and effort. That is why older projects usually have a long time between different releases. 

# Need for speed
The current world of software development is demanding more and more speed each day. As a company you have to be able to deliver software faster than the competition. Building software faster will result in getting new customers because of the new features and that means more income. 

Building and releasing software faster should not result in more bugs in the software, because there is nothing as irritating for a customer as a not working product. If a customer notices and suffers under a lot of bugs, he will not be happy and might go to the competition. That is why we still need to have a process that ensures that our software is working as expected.

// TODO: 
write stuff about that with the current status quo development pipeline speeding up isn't possible any more but the whole cloud paradigm does.
