Almost every application uses secrets to access secured parts of the software landscape. I think that almost everyone can relate to me when I say that keeping secrets in config files with the rest of your code base is a very "easy" solution for keeping your secrets. A sentence that I have heared a lot when it comes to keeping secrets in your code base is:

> 'Why not, the only persons that can access our code base is our team self.'

This was something that I told myself too, but keeping your secrets in configuration files doens't only mean that they are stored in the repository. Deploying software means putting your code in a place where it can run including all the configuration files that are necesarry to run your software. So when you deploy software to a test, acceptance and production environment means three more places of where your secrets are stored.

Software that is deployed is vulnerable for hacking attempts and you can try as hard as you can, but hackers will eventually be able to access your environment and have access to all of your secrets. In this way, they immediatly have access to your database or other secured parts of your landscape.

There are many best practices that can prevent hackers to get access to your environment, but what if they get through en get access to your environment? Do you feel safe engough to keep your secrets lying around? In this blog I will tell you about the basics of secret management with [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).

## Secret management

In my opinion, a secret is everything that grants authentication or authorization for a user or application. So a secret can be somehting like a username/password, database credentials, API tokens or even TLS certificates.

If you ask me, managing secrets is hard. Managing secrets includes a few things. One of them is keeping track of whom has access to which secret (Access control management). The second thing is that you should know whom is using which secret (Audit trail). So in case of a security breach you can see who is responsible for the breach. The third part of secret management is to able to rotate a secret.

These management tasks come with 'a few' challenges. For example, one of the most obvious challenges is __secret sprawl__. This means that all your secrets are spread in your application landscape. A few places of which you can find your secrets is in your source code (hard coded), in configuration files and ultimately in your VCS (Version Control system like git). How do you keep track of where all your secrets are?

The second challenge is a consequence of secret sprawl, namely __access control__. Try to keep track of whom has access to which secret if they are all spread accross your code base. For example, if you have a development team that can access your code base, the whole team has access to your secrets. Or if you have an ops guy that is in charge over your environments, he can access the secrets that are in the configuration files. In other words, there are most likely more people who have access to your secrets then you know. Beside knowing who has access to your secrets, it can also be very usefull to know whom has used a secret. So you can find out what secret has been compromised and by whom. 

The third challenge has to do with __secret rotation__. It's very common to change a secret once in a while. There can be different reasons why you should do that, for example if a secret gets compromised, or if a secret gets out dated. It's very hard to rotate a secret that is hardcoded in the system or a secret that is spread across multiple applications. The change that you missed a secret in some hidden configuration file is always there.

## Hashicorp vault 

Hashicorp vault is, as the name says, a vault that can be used to store secrets. Vault serves as a centralized place where you can store your secrets. All secrets are stored on a virtual file sytem. So every secret has its a path on which it can be accessed. Beside a centralized place to keep your secrets, using vault has a few more benefits. To keep your secrets save, all secrets stored in vault are encrypted. At rest as well as in transit are secrets encrypted, so if someone gets access to the secrets they can't read it.

Beside keeping your secrets safe, vault also provide an acces control layer (ACL). This means that you are able to create policies to which you can restrict the access for your secrets to whom needs access. Vault operates on a __secure by default__ standard, and as such, an empty policy grants __no permissions__ in the system. Therefore policies must be created to govern the behavior of clients and instrument Role-based Access Control (RBAC) by specifiying access privileges (authorization).

All secrets that are used are accessed via vault, this means that vault can keep a detailed log of all requests and responses. Because every operation with Vault is an API request/response, the audit log contains every authenticated interaction with Vault, including errors. It's possible to enable multiple audit devices, vault will send the the audit logs to all the devices enabled. Each line in the audit log is a JSON object. There are currently two types of logs, request and response. The line contains all of the information for any given request and response. By default, all the sensitive information is first hashed before logged in the audit logs.

So, all secrets are centralized and secured in vault and are provided to applications via a request/response API. That should be enough, wright? We keep track of everyone who access our secrets and they are at a centralized placed. Eventhough your secrets are kept safe at rest and in transit doesn't mean that they are forever uncompromised.

Vault is built knowing that applications usually do a terrible job in keeping secrets. Inevitably secrets will show up in a central log, diagnostic output or even external monitoring. Even though Vault secures the secret and even encrypts it on the way to the application, the app isn't trusted.

### Dynamic secrets

Knowing that applications do a terrible job at keeping secrets, vault introduced dyanmic secrets. The idea behind a dynamic secret is instead of providing a long lived credential which inevitably leaks, vault provide short lived ephemeral secrets. For example, vault provides a secret that is valid for 30 days. So, if the secret gets leaked out, it's only available for a bounded period of time. 

The second benefit of using dynamic secrets is that a secret can be unique for each client. Before, all applications would come in and read a static database credential. In case of a security breach and your secret gets compromised, it's very hard to determine where the breach took place. When each secret is unique for each client, it's very easy to determine where the security breach took place.

Another benefit that comes with using unique secrets is that we can have a much better revocation story. So now when we now what secret is compromised, we can revoke it. This results in an isolated security breach that doesn't effect all the other services whom are using there own secret.

## Vaultâ€™s architecture

Vault has a highly plugable architecture. This means that it can ......

## Demo

At first we have to deploy Vault. For development purposes Vault has a 'dev' server mode which doesn't require additional settings.This blog won't go into all the settings that are required for setting up Vault, this blog will fully focus on the use of Vault in .Net Core.

To make it easy for you I created a [demo project](https://github.com/tom171296/SecretManagement-Vault) where I placed a docker file that you can use to start a Vault instance in dev mode. You can verify that Vault is running by going to [localhost:8200](http://localhost:8200), here you should see the Vault UI like the picture below.
